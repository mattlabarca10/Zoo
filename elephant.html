      Elephants are the largest land mammals, native to Africa and Asia, and are known for 
      their massive size, intelligence, and social structure. These herbivores have distinctive
      features, including long trunks, large ears, and thick, wrinkled skin. Elephants live in 
      tight-knit family groups, with females leading the herd and males generally living solitary 
      lives after reaching maturity. They are crucial to their ecosystems, helping to shape 
      landscapes and maintain balance by dispersing seeds and creating waterholes. There are two 
      main species: the African elephant and the Asian elephant, each with unique traits and habitats.
