        Parrots are vibrant, colorful birds found primarily in tropical and subtropical 
        regions around the world, including South and Central America, Africa, and Oceania. 
        Known for their intelligence and ability to mimic human speech, parrots are social 
        creatures that often live in large flocks. They have strong, curved beaks and 
        zygodactyl feet, which aid them in climbing and feeding on seeds, nuts, fruits, and 
        sometimes even insects. The family includes over 400 species, with some being popular 
        pets due to their engaging personalities and remarkable vocal abilities.
