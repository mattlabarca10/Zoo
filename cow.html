        Cows are large domesticated (but not in India!) herbivores found on farms worldwide, 
        primarily raised for milk, meat, and leather. They are members of the Bovidae family 
        and have been integral to human agriculture for thousands of years. Known for their 
        large, stocky build and peaceful nature, cows are ruminants with specialized stomachs 
        that allow them to digest tough plant materials like grasses. They are often found in 
        herds and play a significant role in many cultures, providing sustenance and economic 
        value through dairy and beef production.
